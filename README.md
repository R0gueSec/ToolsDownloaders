# ToolsDownloaders

Both of these bash scripts download pentesting tools and organize them into directories:

kali-adtools.sh downloads Active Directory pentesting tools.

kali-tools.sh downloads non-AD pentesting tools.

kali-apps.sh downloads useful applications that install into kali, but not into a user directory.

These scripts are especially useful when starting a fresh install of Kali.
